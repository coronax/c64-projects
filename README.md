# C64 Projects from Coronax's Project Blog

This repository contains several small programs that were created for early entries on the [Project Blog].  Most of the C64 assembly files are written for [CBM prg Studio].

## Contents

- **screenscroller** - A simple (an unoptimized) demonstration of smooth horizontal scrolling. From [A C64 graphics hack part 1] (July 15, 2012) and [part 2] (July 22, 2012).
- **spi-comm-test** - An experiment connecting the C64 Use Port to an Arduino with bit-banged SPI on a CIA. Includes both the C64 and Arduino programs. From [Trivial communications] (Dec 23, 2012).
- **user-port-adc** - Test code for attaching an MCP3008 analog-to-digital converter to the C64 User Port. From [C64 User Port Input] (Aug 26, 2012) and [Detecting Light] (Sept 2, 2012).
